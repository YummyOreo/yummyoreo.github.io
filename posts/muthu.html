					<div class="text">
						<p>In the early 1900s, two decades after the discovery of the
							tuberculosis bacteria, physicians and researchers were still
							debating
							the role of the bacilli in a tuberculosis infection, Muthu among
							them.
							Muthu distilled this debate to two arguments:
							it is either caused by infection or social factors, clarifying
							"we
							cannot have it both ways."<span class="footnote" id="ft-10"><a
									href="#ft10">10</a></span> For Muthu, settling
							this issues was
							very important, stating</p>
						<blockquote>
							<hr>
							<p>
								It is time, therefore, that we lay aside every bias and
								prejudice and set out to explore every avenue in the
								light of
								present knowledge, and make a searching investigation of
								all the
								factors that lied behind this great plague which claims
								its
								victims by millions all over the world.<span

						</blockquote>
					</div>
					<div class="animation" id="animation-6">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>Muthu eventually settled on the latter, arguing
						throughout the book for a
						purely social cause of the disease—one not caused by a bacteria.
						But that cannot be said about where we have settled today.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>From a purely biological perspective, we currently
						believe that tuberculosis
						is, indeed, caused solely by a bacteria (<i>Mycobacterium
							tuberculosis</i> to
						be specific). But as author and advocate John Green proclaimed in his
						book, <i>Everything is Tuberculosis</i>, "Ultimately, we are the cause
						[of
						tuberculosis]."<span class="footnote" id="ft12"><a
								href="#ft12">12</a></span> To
						Green and many other advocates, tuberculosis is not just caused by the
						bacteria <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> but also the choices we as a
						society have made and continue to make.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="split even">
					<div class="text">
						<p><span class="tab"></span>In 2023, over 1 million people died of
							tuberculosis—yet we know how
							to cure
							it.<span class="footnote" id="ft-13"><a
									href="#ft13">13</a></span> This
							wasn't a new development, we found out how to cure it less than
							30 years after Muthu's <i>Pulmonary Tuberculosis</i> was
							released.
							For those 1 million people (and 10 million others that
							contracted TB in 2023), their tuberculosis wasn't only caused by
							the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, but also a lack of access
							to
							treatment, testing, and nutritional support—which we have
							caused. If those people had accurate and affordable testing,
							treatment, and nutritional support, many of them wouldn't have

				<div class="full">
					<p>Before we dive into Muthu's ideas, we should first understand what he is
						refuting: a bacterial theory of tuberculosis.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="split">
					<div class="text">
						<p><span class="tab"></span>In the late 1800s and early 1900s, many
							researchers relied on the so-called "seed and soil" metaphor to
							explain this new bacterial theory of disease. The seed usually
							refers to the
							outside cause, such as the bacteria. While the soil refers to
							the thing that the seed is affecting.<span class="footnote"
								id="ft-14"><a href="#ft14">14</a></span></p>
					</div>
					<div class="animation" id="animation-13"></div>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>To people who believed in germ theory, bacteria were
						little seeds floating in
						the air, ready to plant themselves wherever they could find the
						soil.<span class="footnote" id="ft-15"><a href="#ft15">15</a></span>
						They believed that bacteria
						infected human bodies, causing disease. An 1874 <i>New York Times</i>
						article
						put it perfectly:</p>
					<br>
					<blockquote>
						<hr>
						<p>The thought itself is an impressive and natural one, that there may
							be a 'cholera seed' or 'scarlet-fever germ' or 'typhoid sporule'
							floating through the air, just as there are floating seeds of
							thistles or dandelion, or germs of tulip-trees or limes, or
							scores of the nameless plants which sow themselves wherever
							there is the slightest bit of soil or moisture favoring.<span
								class="footnote" id="ft-16"><a
									href="#ft16">16</a></span></p>
						<hr>
					</blockquote>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>Muthu obviously had problems with this theory. One
						of the biggest being that it didn't bring anything new to the table
						curatively in the first couple decades, and he didn't believe it could.
						Aside from Koch's Lymph, which turned out to be fraudulent, the
						discovery of the tuberculosis bacteria yielded no new curative measures
						nor had preventative measures produced any results (at least in Muthu's
						eyes).<span class="footnote" id="ft-17"><a href="#ft17">17</a></span> He
						also saw multiple contradictions during his time studying tuberculosis,
						including "If pulmonary tuberculosis were a contagious disease,
						consumptive hospitals and sanatoria would be hotbeds of infection, and
						there would be evidence of the physicians, nurses, and others engaged in
						them being infected by the disease," going on to state "there is a
						remarkable history of immunity from consumption among the
						staff...."<span class="footnote" id="ft-18"><a
								href="#ft18">18</a></span> These factors,
						among many others, all contributed to Muthu looking elsewhere for the
						cause of tuberculosis.<span class="footnote" id="ft-19"><a
								href="#ft19">19</a></span> It wasn't in the seeds
						floating in the air,
						for him, instead it was something that was "in its infancy" at the time,
						yet was very promising in Muthu's eyes: biochemistry. In addition to his
						own ideas of how the body worked.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="split even">
					<div class="text">
						<p><span class="tab"></span>Muthu believed that sickness and disease was
							inherently the body's adjustment
							to change in their environment. Essentially the body's attempts
							to
							maintain equilibrium or homeostasis.<span class="footnote"
								id="ft-20"><a href="#ft20">20</a></span> The process of
							adjusting to
							change causes "diseased conditions," but "the process of
							diseased
							conditions becomes the process of
							healing."<span class="footnote" id="ft-21"><a
									href="#ft21">21</a></span> Put simply,
							disease is a part of the process of healing. This leaves us with
							a world
							where "the organism is constantly adapting itself to the varying
							changes
							in the environment," causing disease when changing, but
							eventually
							adapting and bringing the body back to
							harmony.<span class="footnote" id="ft-22"><a

					<div class="animation" id="animation-18"></div>

						<p><span class="tab"></span>His theory went all the way down to the

									href="#ft23">23</a></span> Because
							the property of every cell is determined by its surroundings,

					</div>
					<div class="animation" id="animation-19">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>For tuberculosis, Muthu cited malnutrition
						as the main factor that
						causes tuberculosis. In his book, after refuting bacteria as a
						cause of tuberculosis, he looks to biochemistry for an
						explanation. Specifically he looked at the body's
						metabolism—which he defined as the pathways between food intake
						and the nutrients getting into the blood. A working metabolism
						was crucial to the health of the body: if there is "a break in
						any part of [the metabolism], any deficiency in the quantity and
						quality of food material...", he claims, "will bring about
						abnormal changes in the chemical processes and reactions which,
						if continued, would ultimately lead to pathological and diseased
						conditions."<span class="footnote" id="ft-24"><a
								href="#ft24">24</a></span> A breakdown of the metabolism
						would also cause a
						lack of
						nutrition, which likely causes such "abnormal changes." This
						lack of nutrition is what Muthu cites as being fundamental to
						the cause of tuberculosis, stating "Tuberculosis is
						fundamentally a disease of lowered
						nutrition...."<span class="footnote" id="ft-25"><a
								href="#ft25">25</a></span> The
						lowered nutrition, in the context of his theory about change,
						causes tuberculosis through the body's reaction and attempts to
						adjust back to equilibrium.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>There can be multiple causes of malnutrition, aside
						from simply not eating
						enough, according to Muthu. He first cites stale and cooked foods as
						being a source of malnutrition, stating that "in stale, cooked food
						there is a deficiency and destruction of enzymes."<span class="footnote"
							id="ft-26"><a href="#ft26">26</a></span> It isn't just the
						destruction of enzymes that makes stale food cause malnutrition, but
						also the destruction of chemicals and vitamins and the introduction of
						"purion and other toxins," which cause malnutrition according to
						Muthu.<span class="footnote" id="ft-27"><a href="#ft27">27</a></span>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>He also claims that civilization can cause
						malnutrition, and subsequently
						tuberculosis. Specifically, parts of civilization cause the body's
						metabolism to become impaired, which then causes tuberculosis. These
						disrupters were mainly dirty, "insanitary" environments, mental strain
						and the aforementioned food, which Muthu claims are synonymous with
						civilization.<span class="footnote" id="ft-28"><a
								href="#ft28">28</a></span> These disrupters "induce
						chemical changes which impair
						normal metabolism," causing malnutrition and tuberculosis.<span
							class="footnote" id="ft-29"><a href="#ft29">29</a></span> This
						"excessive physical strain" is caused by "poverty and insanitation" and
						likely the overworking of people in civilized society, which he talks
						about earlier in the book.<span class="footnote" id="ft-30"><a
								href="#ft30">30</a></span></p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>But what were these insanitary conditions? In a
						paper published a year after
						his book, he outlines what he considers insanitary conditions as when
						there is "drainage, disposal of sewage, clean water supply, good housing
						is very low" going further to say that ventilation is also very
						important.<span class="footnote" id="ft-31"><a
								href="#ft31">31</a></span> These conditions,
						specifically poor ventilation, were often
						synonymous with a space being enclosed, causing people to be deprived of
						light and fresh air, and new Western cities.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="full">
					<p><span class="tab"></span>These factors alone wouldn't cause death because,
						according to Muthu, disease
						is the body's adjustment to change; disease is healing. But, at the
						time, 1 million people died of tuberculosis in India each year. To
						explain this, Muthu proposed a different stage of disease, one where it
						becomes deadly. This stage appears when someone stays in insanitary and
						malnourished conditions.<span class="footnote" id="ft-32"><a
								href="#ft32">32</a></span> Staying in these conditions
						long enough causes
						the body to fail "to adjust itself to the abnormal conditions," causing
						the "functional adaptive [changes]" that the body made to pass onto
						"structural changes, and structural to more or less permanent organic
						changes," which cause the disease to turn truly pathogenic (in the sense
						that it can cause death).<span class="footnote" id="ft-33"><a

				<hr class="full">
				<div class="split even brokenup">
					<div class="text">
						<p>Muthu didn't deny the existence of bacteria, partly because he had
							seen them with his own eyes, but instead believed they were
							caused by tuberculosis, not the cause of. To explain bacteria
							and their relation to disease, Muthu turns to the French
							scientist Antoine Béchamp and his theory of microzymes—the
							"anatomical units" of life. "These microzymes exist always in
							every part of every organism, in every phase of its existence,
							and are an essential element of life, of disease, and of our
							bodily destruction," they are essentially the building blocks of
							life.<span class="footnote" id="ft-34"><a

					<p>When they are subjected to stresses,

						its normal health...."<span class="footnote" id="ft-35"><a
								href="#ft35">35</a></span> In simple terms, the cells of

						the bacteria specifically come from the blood (likely due to a
						lack of nutrition in the blood).<span class="footnote" id="ft-36"><a
								href="#ft36">36</a></span> They also often only appear
						when the disease is pathogenic because the "vicious environment"
						causes the microzymes "to take on pathogenic properties which
						make for diseases processes."<span class="footnote" id="ft-37"><a

						Sanatorium were frequently located on hill tops because of their cold,
						dry air, which was considered healing and the opposite of the humid, wet
						air in most of India. Hill tops were not only places for sanatoriums,
						but also bases (which also functioned as sanatoriums). (Sanitary

						<i>Colonizing the Body: State Medicine and Epidemic Disease in
							Nineteenth-Century India</i> (University of California Press,
						1993), 79) They were so popular that by 1894, 23% of British Troops were
						located in hill top bases. (Sanitary Commissioner, <i>Annual Report of
