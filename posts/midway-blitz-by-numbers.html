				<h3>By The Numbers</h3>
				<br>
				<p>On September 8th, the Department of Homeland Security launched "Operation Midway Blitz" in Chicago-an operation focused on imposing terror on our communities and abducting immigrants. Over 3,000 people have been abducted over the Chicagoland area. Below is an attempt to comprehend the scale of this terror.</p>

				<h3>A Chilling Effect</h3>

					<p class="content">On Tuesday, October 14th, in a residential neighborhood in South Chicago, federal agents deployed <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peternickeas.bsky.social/post/3m36hm55chs2q" target="_blank">around 11 canisters</a> of tear gas into a crowd of protesters who formed after agents rammed a car. Since the start of Operation "Midway Blitz," agents deployed chemical weapons (including pepper spray) over 50 times in Chicago, largely disregarding the temporary restraining order (TRO) Judge Ellis place on October 9th restricting the use of force by agents.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>
				These deployment of tear gas and pepper spray are an attempt to instill fear into any resistance, having a chilling effect on protesters and free speech. Images of masked men in military fatigue throwing canisters of tear gas is scary for many. It makes them second guess if it is worth it for them to speak out against these deportations. It is no wonder why these agents are mostly running around in military fatigue. Its because they know it instills fear. They know it is scary and that is exactly what they want.

				<h3>Drastic Increase</h3>
				<p>
				As federal agents poured into Chicago, detentions and deportations drastically increased. In "Operation Midway Blitz" alone, there were over 3,000 people deported. This increase has stricken fear into many as agents roam around the city. This fear come, in part, from agents targeting <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/teacher-detained-ice-rayito-del-sol-chicago-daycare-broadview/" target="_blank">day care teachers in front of kids</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/02/south-shore-residents-return-to-ransacked-apartments-try-to-move-out-after-ice-raid-it-looks-like-hell/">raiding entire apartment buildings</a>, and <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/25/chicago-street-vendors-ice/" target="_blank">abducting street vendors</a> trying to stay alive. But also from the chaos they cause as they abduct people. Even after CPB commander Gregory Bovino left Chicago in November, agents are still active, although to a lesser extent.

				<p>The data from the administration only goes to the October 15th and is shown in orange. A 7 day rolling average of data is shown in blue. I have added my tracking of <a href="https://www.icirr.org/" target="_blank">ICIRR</a>-confirmed sightings in green (take the sightings with a grain of salt as agent activity isn't the only aspect that can effect those numbers).</p>

				<p>
Most deportations seemed to happen during the work week (see heatmap above), with the exception of Monday. Deportations also happen mostly in the morning, with almost all of my recorded sightings happening before 1pm. Agents are likely targeting people going to work, contributing to our communities and paying taxes. The only notable exception to this morning pattern is when <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/28/border-patrol-gregory-bovino-federal-court" target="_blank">Bovino had to testify in front of Judge Ellis on October 28th</a>. On October 28th, the majority of sightings were <em>after</em> 1pm, with the latest happening around 4:50pm.

				<p>
				ICE's activity has been mostly focused on already marginalized communities. Specifically Hispanic neighborhoods, such as Berwyn and Cicero, where shops are seeing a (sharp decrease in sales as people are afraid to go outside). This focus on specific communities leads to other, whiter and wealthier communities to not see the full impact of ICE's activity. While social media can greatly reduce the effect of this, giving a window into those communities and mobilizing many, it is only a window.

				<p>ICE seems to flip flop between north and south of North Ave, targeting a community for a couple of days straight, putting strain on the whole community before moving on to the next community.</p>
