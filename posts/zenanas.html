				<h2>From Britain to the Zenanas</h2>
				<h4>How British Physicians Treated Tuberculosis in India</h4>
				<p class="byline">By Quinn Yates.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Initial attempts by the British in the early 1800s to convert Indian women to
					Christianity focused on reaching women through schooling. But, due to social
					customs prohibiting women from attending school, this approach was
					infeasible.<span class="footnote" id="ft-1"><a href="#ft1">1</a></span>
					The taboo against schooling for Indian women provided the British with a reason
					for conversion: they were trapped in a sexist society. In an article named
					“Hindu Female Education” published in The <i>Calcutta Christian Observer</i>,
					Priscilla
					Chapman articulated the importance of female education, stating, “the subject of
					female education occupies the greater attention… because of its intrinsic
					importance….” Her solution to the lack of female education was to preach the
					gospel, which, if missionaries didn’t, “[they] shall wait for ever [for female
					education].”<span class="footnote" id="ft-2"><a href="#ft2">2</a></span> This
					reason was echoed by
					missionaries at the time. But they had
					yet to find a replacement for schools by the 1840s, when the aforementioned
					edition of The <i>Calcutta Christian Observer</i> was released. Where could they
					convert the women? The zenana (a place in a Muslim, Sikh or Hindu house in India
					that is reserved for women) provided a solution to this problem.<span
						class="footnote" id="ft-3"><a href="#ft3">3</a></span></p>
				<br>
				<p>
					At the time, missionaries viewed zenanas as freedom depriving, secluded places.
					The women were inaccessible to male missionaries; they were, in the words of
					Julius Richter (a physician at the time), “banished to their zenanas.”<span
						class="footnote" id="ft-4"><a href="#ft4">4</a></span> To him,
					and other missionaries, the women were trapped in the zenana and needed
					spiritual and physical salvation.<span class="footnote" id="ft-5"><a
							href="#ft5">5</a></span> This line of thinking would form
					another
					reason to enter the zenana: they needed saving.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>An early attempt to enter a zenana was in 1858 by John Fordyce’s wife.<span
						class="footnote" id="ft-6"><a href="#ft6">6</a></span> At the time,
					there were few female missionaries.<span class="footnote" id="ft-7"><a
							href="#ft7">7</a></span> The main reason for John Fordyce to
					choose women to enter the zenanas was because of Indian customs at the time. In
					the 1800s, women (mostly from upper castes) were culturally prohibited from
					seeing men from outside of their immediate family.<span class="footnote"
						id="ft-8"><a href="#ft8">8</a></span> This restriction prohibited male
					missionaries from entering the zenana, leaving the task to female missionaries.
					As Richter, a British physician, stated, “these zenanas are inaccessible for
					missionaries and native preachers all over India….”<span class="footnote"
						id="ft-9"><a href="#ft9">9</a></span> (By “missionaries and native
					preachers” he is only referring to <i>male</i> missionaries and <i>male</i>
					native preachers.) Later on in his book, Richter would conclude that “if men
					could not do this, it was agreed, here is an immense field open to women
					workers.”<span class="footnote" id="ft-10"><a href="#ft10">10</a></span> And
					they would fill that field; Fordyce’s wife would be the one of the first of many
					British women to enter a zenana in the late 1800s and early 1900s. And in the
					process, she helped open up missionary and physician work in India to the many
					women that would follow.<span class="ft" id="ft-11"><a
							href="#ft11">11</a></span></p>
				<br>
				<p>This opening led to an increase in British women entering the zenanas in the latter
					half of the 1800s. According to Richter, by 1881, there were 479 female
					missionaries who had visited more than 9,000 zenanas.<span class="ft"
						id="ft-12"><a href="#ft12">12</a></span> This number likely
					increased over the years as physicians and missionaries from Britain, the United
					States and other nations.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Dr. Fanny Butler was also an early British zenana missionary. Butler was a doctor and
					missionary born in Britain. In a sketch of Dr. Butler, E. M. Tonge described her
					as a very religious person growing up, writing “Fanny Butler did not wait until
					sailing for India to begin missionary work, but quietly used opportunities of
					leading students and patients to Christ.”<span class="ft" id="ft-13"><a
							href="#ft13">13</a></span> Butler was also interested in
					medicine and was one of the first women to get her license in Britain. After
					getting her license, Butler sailed to India as a part of the Church of England
					Zenana Missionary Society, where she would spend the rest of her life.<span
						class="ft" id="ft-14"><a href="#ft14">14</a></span></p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Dr. Butler was certainly not the last doctor to go to India. During the late
					1800s, women in Britain started to enter medical school for the first time. Some
					of these women had started their careers in nursing<span class="ft"
						id="ft-15"><a href="#ft15">15</a></span> (which was often one of
					the only jobs available to women in the medical field), but then entered medical
					school and eventually became doctors.<span class="ft" id="ft-16"><a
							href="#ft16">16</a></span> But becoming a doctor in Britain, for
					many women, did not guarantee a job. Doctors who did not go looking outside of
					Britain for work “struggled to maintain a general practice….”<span class="ft"
						id="ft-17"><a href="#ft17">17</a></span> This lack of
					jobs, mixed with other discrimination, put pressure on these female doctors to
					seek jobs elsewhere.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>For some, India was an appealing option.<span class="ft" id="ft-18"><a
							href="#ft18">18</a></span> Not only did India offer women job
					opportunities, the colonial state also provided them with new motivation and
					training. India was motivating to British women physicians who viewed Indian
					women as needing medical attention and “saving” from the aforementioned
					seclusion.<span class="ft" id="ft-19"><a href="#ft19">19</a></span> Indian
					customs dictating who Indian women could see played a
					huge role in women not receiving the apparent medical attention they needed.
					Specifically, Indian women didn’t get medical attention because they were barred
					from seeing men outside the family, restricting medical attention to the small
					female-specific hospitals and dispensaries that existed at the time (although,
					that would increase with the increase in zenana missionaries).<span class="ft"
						id="ft-20"><a href="#ft20">20</a></span> As the
					British Surgeon General Balfour wrote in 1872:
				</p>
				<p class="indent">If a Mohammedan woman or Hindu of the higher castes be attacked with
					any severe
					disease, or have any bones injured, neither of them obtain the benefit of the
					knowledge which is at their doors, because it is only as yet in the possession
					of medical men, and men are not admissible into the women’s presence.<span
						class="ft" id="ft-21"><a href="#ft21">21</a></span></p>
				<p>
					These women in the zenanas still had access to Indian medical care, but many
					Westerners did not consider the care valid at the time. Many British saw the
					zenana as unsanitary, which reinforced the notion that the women needed rescuing
					from the unsanitary and freedom depriving zenana.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>For many women, including, most likely, Dr. Butler, health was not the only
					motivating factor. Christianity was another motivating factor. As was mentioned
					before, Dr. Butler was reportedly very religious growing up and “did not wait
					until sailing for India to begin missionary work,” suggesting that religion was
					a motivating factor in her decision to go to India.<span class="ft"
						id="ft-22"><a href="#ft22">22</a></span> These British doctors,
					as will be laid out later on, did not leave the opportunity to teach their
					patients about the Bible, including religious teachings at every chance, from
					dispensaries to the zenanas.</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="wrapper">
				<br>
				<p>Colonial medicine during British rule was, with few exceptions like the zenana
					missionaries, restricted to Europeans.<span class="ft" id="ft-23"><a
							href="#ft23">23</a></span> Tuberculosis (TB) was no exception.
					British colonialists did not understand how prevalent TB was in India (or, to be
					more specific, how prevalent the disease infected Indians). Some British
					colonists even believed that Indians were immune to TB.<span class="ft"
						id="ft-24"><a href="#ft24">24</a></span> This lack of
					knowledge was largely due to the lack of colonial medical reach into Indian
					communities, which would begin to change as colonial rule changed.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The zenanas provided one of the only windows into the reality of TB in India for the
					British.<span class="ft" id="ft-25"><a href="#ft25">25</a></span> One of the
					best examples is that of Arthur Lankester, a British
					researcher and missionary who, from July of 1914 to June of 1916, traveled
					across India gathering evidence to “stimulate inquiry regarding” tuberculosis in
					India.<span class="ft" id="ft-26"><a href="#ft26">26</a></span> Lankester hoped
					that his finding would “lead to that spread of
					knowledge which is the successful preliminary to successful preventative
					effort.”<span class="ft" id="ft-27"><a href="#ft27">27</a></span> One of the
					most important places he got his information from was
					missionaries—such as those visiting the zenanas. When addressing the question of
					where he gets his information in the first part of his book, Lankester stated,
					“I have tried whenever possible to obtain the opinions of civil surgeons,
					doctors of”Lady Dufferin” hospitals, private practitioners, medical
					missionaries, as well as of non-medical zenana workers, selecting always for
					special inquiry those who have remained in the same district for 20 or 30
					years.” Lankester went on to explain how zenana missionaries hold the most
					valuable information.<span class="ft" id="ft-28"><a href="#ft28">28</a></span>
					Many of those “doctors of ‘Lady Dufferin hospitals’”
					were zenana missionaries too. As will be discussed later on, these zenana
					missionaries often opened and staffed hospitals specifically for women, such as
					those funded by the Dufferin fund (instantiated by Lady Dufferin), which is
					likely what “‘Lady Dufferin’ hospitals” is referring to.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					According to Lankester, during the early 1900s, TB was spreading rapidly
					throughout India, specifically into rural areas “where formerly it
					[tuberculosis] was almost unknown.”<span class="ft" id="ft-29"><a
							href="#ft29">29</a></span> He mainly attributed the rise of TB
					to two things: British rule and the zenanas. British raj caused overcrowding and
					forced people into enclosed spaces, which caused the increase in TB.<span
						class="ft" id="ft-30"><a href="#ft30">30</a></span> The
					zenanas were “enclosed”, Lankester reasoned, causing them to become unsanitary
					and cause TB.<span class="ft" id="ft-31"><a href="#ft31">31</a></span> It is
					important to note that enclosures causing TB was not an
					uncommon idea during that time, the main point of contention being whether
					unsanitary/enclosed spaces could be fixed or not.<span class="ft" id="ft-32"><a
							href="#ft32">32</a></span> Lankester was among the
					ones that believed they could be fixed.
				</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="wrapper">
				<br>
				<p>Shortly after after Dr. Butler arrived in India, she joined the Zenana Mission House,
					a dispensary in Bhagalpur.<span class="ft" id="ft-33"><a
							href="#ft33">33</a></span> For the next four and a half years,
					she stayed
					at the dispensary, treating the few patients that they got.<span class="ft"
						id="ft-34"><a href="#ft34">34</a></span> Dr. Butler
					staffing a dispensary was not uncommon. Many women doctors from Britain would
					open women dispensaries and hospitals that provided treatments ranging from
					tuberculcilin shots to “open air” treatment.<span class="ft" id="ft-35"><a
							href="#ft35">35</a></span></p>
				<br>
				<p>In his sketch of Dr. Butler, E. M. Tonge recounted a story of Dr. Butler treating a
					woman in a zenana: some time during those four years at the dispensary, she
					received a telegram from a Maharani’s manager (the wife of a Maharaja, a
					prince). After going on a 12-hour journey and arriving at the Maharani’s house,
					she was sent back home because the Maharani didn’t want to see an
					Englishwomen.<span class="ft" id="ft-36"><a href="#ft36">36</a></span> This
					rejection shows how, even after the zenana missionaries
					started to enter the zenana, they were not always accepted by the Indian women.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Maharani’s manager eventually telegrammed Dr. Butler after three weeks. This
					time, the Maharani would accept Dr. Butler’s care. The Maharani was likely in a
					zenana. “The Maharani was behind a red curtain in the one large room of a poor
					little house,” he wrote.<span class="ft" id="ft-37"><a
							href="#ft37">37</a></span> The zenana was also busy, there were
					“some 300
					servants and retainers were about the place,” presumably to treat the
					Maharani.<span class="ft" id="ft-38"><a href="#ft38">38</a></span> Once admitted
					into the zenana, Dr. Butler saw “a young women,
					very thin and ill, and with a discontented expression, lying on a silver-legged
					bed. She was wearing a common kurta and sari, glass bangles and a bead
					necklace.”<span class="ft" id="ft-39"><a href="#ft39">39</a></span> The Maharani
					was suffering from TB, which had likely caused her
					to become “very thin” and have a “discontented expression.” But this is not what
					Dr. Butler attributed her state to. Instead, she placed the blame on the native
					healers who had treated the Maharani before Dr. Butler was called, stating,
					according to Tonge, “the invalid, who was suffering from consumption, had been
					treated by many quacks, and as a result had been nearly starved.<span class="ft"
						id="ft-40"><a href="#ft40">40</a></span” Dr. Butler’s reaction to the
							Maharani’s state reveals the missionaries’ view of native
							doctors: an unfavorable one at best or a malicious one at worst.
							The sketch also mentioned what Dr. Butler found unfavorable
							about the treatment: “fresh air had been considered dangerous,
							and for five months she [the Maharani] had not been allowed to
							touch her body with water, though she was occasionally
							oiled.”<span class="ft" id="ft-41"><a href="#ft41">41</a></span>
					While this could be read as the author of this sketch
					giving a commentary on what Dr. Butler thought was dangerous, Tonge is really
					talking about what the native doctors thought was dangerous considering the
					second half of the sentence: “for five months she had not been allowed to touch
					her body with water”. It is also clear that Dr. Butler had not banned the
					Maharani from touching her body with water as Dr. Butler had not been at the
					Maharani’s house for five months. Native doctors keeping the Maharani enclosed
					(or not allowing her to see “fresh air”) went directly against the British
					understanding of TB in India. British colonists believed that the disease was
					caused from being enclosed in an unsanitary place with little air flow or sun
					access. From this view, the Maharani was kept in the very place that was causing
					her illness!</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					According to the sketch, the Maharani approved of Dr. Butler’s treatment and
					wanted
					Dr. Butler to visit her two or three times a day. But Dr. Butler could not agree
					to this
					as she would have to close the dispensary while treating the Maharani. She left
					a few
					days after arriving, notably “not before she had been able to give [the
					Maharani], and
					her little girls some Bible teachings.”<span class="ft" id="ft-42"><a
							href="#ft42">42</a></span> A few months later, “Dr. Butler was
					grieved
					to see a notice of [the Maharani’s] death.” According to Tonge, Dr. Butler
					blamed the
					death on Indian doctors, concluding that the Maharani “probably soon returned to
					quack
					treatment.”<span class="ft" id="ft-43"><a href="#ft43">43</a></span> Further
					reinforcing
					her view on Indian doctors.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					With all that these women did, from taking the long trek from Britain to India
					to treating TB in the zenanas, I struggled to find any Indian perspectives. That
					is likely due to a language barrier, but if you have any books, articles or even
					knowledge pertaining to any of the issues mentioned above, please send them to
					me at qunnyatesv1@gmail.com, I will be very grateful!

					Sadly his finding would never lead to successful preventative efforts. In 1916,
					he submitted his findings to the colonial government but was never released to
					the public, leading him to publish his findings in a book in 1920. (Venkat,
					<i>At the Limits of Cure</i>, 47) As Venkat outlined, “he received mixed
					reviews: some agreed that TB was a serious problem for the health of the Indian
					population, and others insisted that his findings were overblown.” (Venkat,
					<i>At the Limits of Cure</i>, 47) In 2023, in India alone, over 300,000 people
					died of TB, with over 2.8 million being infected. (World Health Organization,
					“Tuberculosis Profile”) It is not hard to say that TB hasn’t been eliminated in
					India.
