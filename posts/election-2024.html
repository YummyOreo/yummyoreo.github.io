			<h2>I'm very disappointed in the American people:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>They would rather vote for a fascist than a women.</li>
				<li>They would rather vote for the economy that experts say is worse than the economy from the current party.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is despicable how the American people voted.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>But it isn't over</b>, American democracy will not end in an instant. But we have taken a dangerous step toward its fall into fascism. One that we (both democrat and republican) will soon regret (I hope).</p>
			<br>
			<h2>On a different note:</h2>
			<p>This is not the time to reject democracy and the results of the election, that too is a step towards fascism that we will regret. Democracy has spoke and chosen Trump, <b>it is now our time to peacefully fight against it</b>. We can both accept the results and fight against fascism. That looks like becoming civically active, voting in mid-terms, protesting, volunteering, and much more. Find your specialty, what you're good at, and use that to fight fascism if you can.</p>
			<br>
			<p>It also looks like helping and protecting the people you love and supporting each other through the next four years and.</p>
			<p>But that doesn't mean you should prioritize activism over your mental health or safety. Both come before activism and are required to be a good activist.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="larger"><b>Stay safe and try and have a good day 💜</b></p>
